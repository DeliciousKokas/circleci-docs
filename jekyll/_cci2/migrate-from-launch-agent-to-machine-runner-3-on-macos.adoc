This page describes how to migrate an existing launch agent installation to machine runner 3.0. Machine runner 3.0 includes improved network resiliency, and a simpler installation management strategy, utilizing operating system packages.

Migrating from launch agent to machine runner 3.0 is a straightforward process. The prerequisites remain the same. First, uninstall and remove launch agent, then, install the machine runner 3.0 agent. The configuration file is 1:1 compatible between the agents so no modifications are needed during the migration

[#uninstall-launch-agent]
== 1. Uninstall launch agent service
The first step is to uninstall launch-agent. If the agent has been installed as a `launchctl` service run the following commands to stop as well as uninstall the service, and delete the service file. 

[,shell]
----
sudo launchtl unload '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
sudo rm -f '/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.circleci.runner.plist'
sudo rm -rf '/opt/circleci'
----

[#move-existing-launch-agent-config]
== 2. Move the existing launch agent config
Machine runner 3.0 is backwards compatible with the launch agent configuration, it can be reused instead of creating a whole new configuration file and runner token for a macOS machine runner. 

[,shell]
----
mkdir -p $HOME/Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner
sudo chown $USER: /Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner
mv /Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner/launch-agent-config.yaml $HOME/Library/com.circleci.runner
sudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.circleci.runner
----

[#install-macos-machine-runner]
== 3. Install the macOS Machine Runner 3.0
Follow the instructions in xref:install-machine-runner-3-on-macos[Install machine runner 3.0 on macOS] to install machine runner 3.0 using a homebrew package.
